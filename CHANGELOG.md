# Changelog

All notable changes to the IMS Agent are documented here. Entries are organized by phase completion, with key deliverables and metrics for each.

## Phase 4.5 — IMS Schedule Tools (2026-04-26)

**Capability:** Direct Q&A against raw IMS schedule data via Anthropic tool_use (function calling).

Previously the Q&A engine could only answer from the synthesized dashboard state. This release adds an agentic tool-use loop so the LLM can query the live IMS XML directly when needed — returning exact float values, dependency chains, task details, and CAM workloads rather than "data not available."

### Added
- `agent/qa/ims_tools.py` — 8 tool handlers: `get_task`, `search_tasks`, `get_critical_path`, `get_tasks_by_cam`, `get_float`, `get_dependencies`, `get_milestones`, `get_behind_tasks`
- `LLMInterface.ask_with_tools()` — agentic loop (up to 5 rounds); all tool calls dispatched and results fed back as `tool_result` messages
- `QAEngine.ask()` upgraded — all LLM-routed questions now use tool_use; direct-answer fast path unchanged
- `tests/test_ims_tools.py` — 41 new tests (tool handlers, dispatcher, schemas, loop behavior, QAEngine integration)

### Metrics
- Total tests: **205** (all passing)
- Tool schemas: **8** (complete Anthropic tool_use JSON schemas)
- Max tool-call rounds: **5** (configurable; prevents infinite loops)

## Phase 4 — Q&A Interface (2026-04-26)

**Capability:** PM can ask natural language questions about the schedule at any time via web chat or Slack.

### Added
- `agent/qa/context_builder.py` — intent detection (9 patterns) + targeted context slicing from dashboard state
- `agent/qa/qa_engine.py` — Q&A engine with direct-answer fast path (~2s) and LLM-routed path (~10s)
- `agent/slack_command.py` — Slack `/ims` slash command via Socket Mode (no public URL required)
- Dashboard chat widget — `POST /api/ask` endpoint + full sessionStorage persistence across auto-refresh
- 26 new tests; 20-question PM acceptance test

### Metrics
- Direct queries: **~2.1s** average response time
- LLM-routed queries: **~10.1s** average response time
- Hallucination rate: **0%** (20-question acceptance test, 2026-04-26)
- Accuracy: All SRA probability values exact (PDR 22.5%, CDR 20.9%, SAT 0.8%)

### Acceptance
- Accepted by John Forbes, 2026-04-26. See [PHASE4-FEEDBACK.md](PHASE4-FEEDBACK.md).

## Phase 3 — Full Automation Loop (2026-04-26)

**Capability:** Fully autonomous cycle — trigger → interviews → update → analysis → output — runs on a cron schedule without human initiation.

### Added
- `agent/cycle_runner.py` — full cycle orchestration with phase tracking and locking
- `agent/scheduler.py` — APScheduler cron trigger (configurable period, default weekly)
- `agent/validation.py` — input validation (backwards movement, large jumps, missing responses)
- `agent/notifier.py` — Slack webhook and SMTP email notifications
- `agent/voice_briefing.py` — LLM + TTS voice briefing generation
- `agent/dashboard/` — FastAPI dashboard server + live HTML dashboard
- `agent/interview_orchestrator.py` — parallel CAM interview coordination
- `main.py` — `--run`, `--serve`, `--schedule` entry points

### Metrics
- Cycle time: **avg 7m 59s** across 3 acceptance test cycles (target: <10 min ✅)
- CAM response rate: **100%** (simulator)
- Validation holds: 3 → 7 across cycles (expected; threshold comparisons tighten after each update)

### Acceptance
- 3 consecutive automated cycles completed without errors. Accepted by John Forbes, 2026-04-26. See [PHASE3-FEEDBACK.md](PHASE3-FEEDBACK.md).

## Phase 2 — Voice Interview Layer (2026-04-25)

**Capability:** Structured voice interview agent that conducts per-CAM conversations, extracts structured data (percent complete, blockers, risks), and feeds it into the Phase 1 analysis pipeline.

### Added
- `agent/voice/interview_agent.py` — conversation state machine (GREETING → TASK → BLOCKER → RISK → RISK_DESC → CONFIRM → CLOSE)
- `agent/voice/cam_simulator.py` — Claude-powered CAM simulator for dev/test
- `agent/voice/stt_engine.py` — STT abstraction (`WhisperSTTEngine`, `MockSTTEngine`)
- `agent/voice/tts_engine.py` — TTS abstraction (`ElevenLabsTTSEngine`, `AzureTTSEngine`, `MockTTSEngine`)
- `agent/voice/teams_connector.py` — Teams/ACS connector stub (full implementation deferred to Phase 5)
- `agent/cam_directory.py` — CAM registry with business hours, retry, and escalation logic

### Notes
- Phase 2 acceptance test used the Claude-powered CAM simulator (5 CAMs, 50 tasks, 100% completion rate)
- Real Teams/ACS voice integration is implemented as a stub; full integration deferred to Phase 5 (TD-011)

### Acceptance
- Accepted by John Forbes, 2026-04-25 (simulator-based). See [PHASE2-FEEDBACK.md](PHASE2-FEEDBACK.md).

## Phase 1 — Proof of Concept (2026-04-25)

**Capability:** Agent reads an IMS, simulates CAM input, runs CPM + Monte Carlo SRA, synthesizes intelligence via Claude, and produces a structured Markdown report.

### Added
- `agent/file_handler.py` — MSPDI XML parsing and write-back
- `agent/critical_path.py` — CPM calculation, float analysis, near-critical flagging
- `agent/sra_runner.py` — Monte Carlo SRA (N=1000); per-milestone P50/P80/P95 and on-time probability
- `agent/llm_interface.py` — single entry point for all Anthropic API calls
- `agent/report_generator.py` — structured Markdown report generation
- `data/sample_ims.xml` — ATLAS synthetic program (57 tasks, 5 CAMs, 7 milestones)
- Architecture Decision Records: ADR-001 (MSPDI XML), ADR-002 (Monte Carlo SRA), ADR-003 (Anthropic API)

### Acceptance
- Accepted by John Forbes, 2026-04-25. See [PHASE1-FEEDBACK.md](PHASE1-FEEDBACK.md).
